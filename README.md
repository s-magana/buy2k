## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, TypeScript, Bootstrap

Setting up the app using Vite, I began this project by first adding routing to the appropriate pages I planned to have. I then created the navbar and logo that would be prominent throughout every part of the app. Next, on the store page, I used json 
data and a currency utiilty to develop cards for each store item. With each item rendering, I built a quantity context that would allow the user to increase/decrease item quantities. With the individual items finished, I made the shopping cart component that displays the items wanting to be purchased and the total price. Lastly, I added local storage and finalized styling decisions. 

## Optimizations

If I were to improve this app, I would primarily add a back-end component. The way I would do this is by allowing user's to make a personal shopping account using an email/password login. Another optimization for the manner the store's data was displayed, I would have connected the project to an API that contains information on actual sellable items.  

## Lessons Learned:

At the end of building this project, I was able to learn so many new things. Besides the rewarding challenge of working with TypeScript and its unqiue features, my knowledge expanded a lot on how to improve front-end qualities. For example, with so many different aspects to the app, making everything responsive and the interface visually appealing across any device helped me understand when certain features need to change. The ability of interacting with each store item by either adding or removing quantities as well taught me new skills.
